AI
1. **Optimize for Branded Keyword Variations**: The site seems to lack optimization for branded keyword variations like "Broadview Strategy Group services", "Broadview Strategy Group public relations", "Broadview Strategy Group marketing", etc. Consider incorporating these variations into the titles, meta descriptions, headings, and body content of relevant pages.
low

2. **Optimize for Location-Based Keywords**: Since the top search queries include location-based terms like "Dallas public relations firm" and "Dallas marketing agency", optimize the content with relevant location-based keywords. This can be done by mentioning the specific locations/cities/regions you serve in the meta descriptions, headings, and body content.

3. **Target "Public Relations" and "Marketing" Keywords**: The top search queries suggest a strong interest in public relations and marketing services. Ensure that the relevant service pages (e.g., /public-relations, /strategic-marketing) are well-optimized for these keywords, including in the titles, meta descriptions, headings, and body content.

No detailed description available.

Show Implementation Details
Add to Todo List
1. **Improve Page Speed on Mobile**
low
technical
- The LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) score of 11280.39ms on mobile is extremely poor and needs significant improvement. This metric measures the time it takes for the largest content element to become visible, and a good score should be under 2.5 seconds. - Optimize images, minify CSS and JavaScript, enable compression, and consider implementing a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to improve page load times on mobile devices.

Show Implementation Details
Add to Todo List
2. **Add H1 Tags**
low
technical
- Several important pages, including the homepage, "Our Story," and "Contact" pages, lack H1 tags. H1 tags are crucial for defining the main heading and conveying the page's topic to search engines. - Add a relevant and keyword-rich H1 tag to these pages.

Show Implementation Details
Add to Todo List
3. **Add Alt Text to Images**
low
technical
- Multiple pages have images without alt text, which can negatively impact accessibility and image SEO. - Add descriptive and keyword-rich alt text to all images, as this helps search engines understand the image content and improves accessibility for users with visual impairments.

Show Implementation Details
Add to Todo List
4. **Optimize Load Times**
low
technical
- While most pages have reasonable load times (under 500ms), the homepage takes over 1 second to load, which is relatively slow. - Optimize images, minify code, enable compression, and consider implementing a CDN to reduce load times across the entire website.

Show Implementation Details
Add to Todo List
5. **Monitor and Improve Core Web Vitals**
low
technical
- Core Web Vitals, including LCP, FID (First Input Delay), and CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift), are crucial for providing a good user experience and are ranking factors for Google. - While the CLS scores are good, the LCP scores, especially on mobile, need improvement. Monitor and optimize these metrics regularly.

6. **Implement Schema Markup**
low
technical
- The data provided does not include information about structured data or Schema markup implementation. - Implement relevant Schema markup, such as Organization, WebSite, and LocalBusiness, to help search engines better understand the website's content and potentially earn rich snippets in search results.

7. **Conduct a Technical SEO Audit**

- While the provided data covers some technical aspects, a comprehensive technical SEO audit can uncover additional issues and optimization opportunities. - Consider conducting a thorough technical SEO audit to identify and address any crawlability, indexability, or other technical issues that may be hindering the website's search performance.

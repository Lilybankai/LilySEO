# SEO Audit Guide

## Overview

LilySEO's SEO audit functionality allows you to analyze websites for SEO issues, performance problems, accessibility concerns, and security vulnerabilities. This guide will walk you through the process of creating and interpreting SEO audits.

## Creating a New Audit

### Prerequisites

- You must have at least one project created in your LilySEO account
- The website you want to audit should be publicly accessible

### Steps to Create an Audit

1. Navigate to your LilySEO dashboard
2. Click on a project or go to the "Projects" section and select a project
3. Click the "New Audit" button
4. Fill out the audit creation form:
   - **Project**: Select the project this audit belongs to (pre-selected if you started from a project)
   - **URL to Audit**: Enter the full URL of the website you want to audit (e.g., https://example.com)
   - **Description** (Optional): Add any notes or context for this audit
   - **Audit Options**: Select which aspects of the website to analyze:
     - SEO Analysis: Check meta tags, headings, content, and more
     - Performance: Analyze page speed and loading performance
     - Mobile Friendliness: Test how well the site works on mobile devices
     - Accessibility: Check for accessibility issues and WCAG compliance
     - Security: Scan for common security vulnerabilities
   - **Audit Depth**: Choose how thoroughly to scan the website:
     - Basic: Homepage only
     - Standard: Up to 10 pages
     - Deep: Up to 50 pages
5. Click "Start Audit" to begin the analysis

### Audit Processing

After creating an audit, it will go through several stages:

1. **Pending**: The audit has been created and is waiting to be processed
2. **Processing**: The audit is currently being analyzed
3. **Completed**: The audit has finished and results are available
4. **Failed**: The audit encountered an error and could not be completed

Depending on the depth of the audit and the size of the website, processing can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes.

## Viewing Audit Results

### Audit Overview

Once an audit is completed, you'll be taken to the audit report page, which includes:

- **Overall Score**: A score from 0-100 indicating the overall health of the website
- **Issue Summary**: A breakdown of issues by category and severity
- **Category Scores**: Individual scores for SEO, performance, accessibility, mobile, and security

### Detailed Reports

The audit report is divided into several tabs:

#### Overview

The overview tab provides a high-level summary of the audit results, including:

- Overall score and category scores
- Number of issues found by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
- Key metrics and recommendations

#### Issues

The issues tab lists all the problems found during the audit, organized by category. For each issue, you'll see:

- Issue title and description
- Severity level
- Affected URL(s)
- Recommendations for fixing the issue

You can filter issues by category (SEO, performance, accessibility, mobile, security) to focus on specific areas.

#### Performance

The performance tab shows detailed metrics about the website's loading speed and performance, including:

- First Contentful Paint
- Speed Index
- Largest Contentful Paint
- Time to Interactive
- Total Blocking Time
- Cumulative Layout Shift

These metrics are based on Google's Core Web Vitals and PageSpeed Insights.

#### Keywords

The keywords tab analyzes the website's keyword usage, including:

- Primary and secondary keywords detected
- Keyword density
- Keyword placement (title, headings, content)
- Keyword competition analysis

#### Charts

The charts tab provides visual representations of the audit data, including:

- Score distribution by category
- Issue distribution by severity
- Performance metrics comparison
- Mobile vs. desktop performance

## Taking Action on Audit Results

### Creating Tasks

You can convert audit issues into actionable tasks:

1. From the issues tab, click the "Create Task" button next to any issue
2. Fill in the task details (title, description, priority, due date)
3. Click "Create Task"

The task will be added to your project's task list, where you can track its progress.

### Downloading Reports

You can download the audit report as a PDF for sharing with clients or team members:

1. Click the "Download PDF" button at the top of the audit report page
2. The report will be generated and downloaded to your device

### Comparing Audits

To track progress over time, you can compare multiple audits of the same website:

1. Go to the project's audit list
2. Select two or more audits using the checkboxes
3. Click the "Compare" button
4. View the comparison report showing changes in scores and issues

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Audits**: Run audits regularly (monthly or quarterly) to track progress and identify new issues
2. **Focus on Critical Issues**: Address critical and high-severity issues first
3. **Verify Fixes**: After fixing issues, run a new audit to verify the improvements
4. **Compare Over Time**: Use the comparison feature to track your SEO progress
5. **Share Reports**: Use the PDF export feature to share reports with clients or team members

## Troubleshooting

### Audit Fails to Complete

If an audit fails to complete, try the following:

1. Verify the website is publicly accessible
2. Check if the website has any access restrictions (e.g., IP blocking, geo-restrictions)
3. Try a less deep audit (e.g., Basic instead of Deep)
4. Check if the website has a robots.txt file that might be blocking the audit

### Low Scores

If your website receives a low score, focus on:

1. Fixing critical and high-severity issues first
2. Addressing on-page SEO issues (meta tags, headings, content)
3. Improving website performance and mobile-friendliness
4. Ensuring accessibility compliance

### Performance Issues

If performance scores are low:

1. Optimize images and other media
2. Minimize CSS and JavaScript
3. Enable browser caching
4. Use a content delivery network (CDN)
5. Reduce server response time

# Todo System Refactoring Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the refactoring work completed on the Todo system to improve performance, maintainability, and user experience. The refactoring primarily focused on replacing mock data with real API data, optimizing data fetching with React Query, and improving the UI components.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Data Fetching Optimization

- **React Query Integration**: Implemented specialized hooks for different Todo views:
  - `useTodos`: General-purpose hook for fetching todos
  - `useCalendarTodos`: Calendar-specific hook that filters for todos with scheduled dates
  - `useKanbanColumns`: Organizes todos into kanban columns with proper caching

- **Caching Strategy**:
  - Implemented appropriate stale times (2 minutes for general todos, 5 minutes for column configurations)
  - Added query invalidation for automatic updates after mutations

### 2. Component Refactoring

- **TodoCalendar Component**:
  - Replaced mock data with real API data using `useCalendarTodos`
  - Implemented optimized date-based grouping of todos
  - Added loading states and error handling
  - Improved UI with consistent styling across the application

- **Kanban Board**:
  - Connected to real data through the `useKanbanColumns` hook
  - Implemented optimistic updates for drag-and-drop operations

### 3. Type Safety Improvements

- Improved type definitions throughout the codebase
- Added proper error handling with typed responses
- Enhanced form validation with proper type checking

## Performance Benefits

- **Reduced Network Requests**: Implemented smart caching to minimize API calls
- **Faster Rendering**: Optimized components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Improved User Experience**: Added loading states and error handling for better feedback

## Future Improvements

- **Virtualization**: Consider implementing virtualized lists for large collections of todos
- **Offline Support**: Implement offline capability for the todo system
- **Batch Operations Optimization**: Further optimize batch operations for better performance
- **Real-time Updates**: Consider implementing WebSockets for real-time collaborative features

## Conclusion

The refactoring work has significantly improved the performance and maintainability of the Todo system. By replacing mock data with real API data and optimizing the components, we've created a more robust and user-friendly experience. The codebase is now more maintainable with better type safety and modular structure.

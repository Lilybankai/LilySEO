# SEO Dashboard Creation Guide

This guide outlines the steps and considerations for creating a comprehensive SEO Report from the audit we have conducted  using Next.js, React, and various UI components.

## 1. Project Setup

2. Utilize shadcn/ui components for consistent and customizable UI elements.
3. Implement Tailwind CSS for styling.



Create a SEO Report page that serves as the dashboard container. Include the following sections:

1. SEO Report Header (this will have default details for lilyseo as standard but pro users with white label access will be able to edit this in the settings we have already created so make sure you look at that )
2. Overall SEO Score
3. SEO Progress / Issue Resolution
4. Category Scores
5. Issues Table
6. AI Recommendations
7. General Recommendations
8. Detailed Metrics

Ensure the layout is responsive, using a grid system for larger screens and a single column for mobile devices.

## 3. Component Breakdown

### 3.1 SEO Header (components/SEO-header.tsx)

- Create a sticky header with the dashboard title. We should also include the site logo and the contact details for lilyseo 
- Include a search input and an "Export Report" button.
- Display the last updated date.

### 3.2 Overall SEO Score (components/overall-score.tsx)

- Use a circular progress indicator to show the overall score.
- Display individual category scores (On-Page SEO, Performance, Usability, Links, Social).
- Implement progress bars for each category.

### 3.3 SEO Progress (components/seo-progress.tsx)

- Create a pie chart showing fixed issues, in-progress issues, and critical issues.
- Display total issues count, resolution percentage, and critical issues count.

### 3.4 Category Scores (components/category-scores.tsx)

- Implement a bar chart and a radar chart to visualize category scores.
- Use tabs to allow users to switch between chart types.

### 3.5 Issues Table (components/issues-table.tsx)

- Create a table listing SEO issues with columns for page, issue description, and priority.
- Implement expandable rows to show issue details, recommendations, and affected elements.
- Add search functionality to filter issues.

### 3.6 AI Recommendations (components/ai-recommendations.tsx)

- Display AI-generated recommendations with priority levels.
- Use appropriate icons to indicate priority (high, medium, low).
- Include recommendations for:
  1. Adding meta descriptions to pages missing them
  2. Providing descriptive alt text for images
  3. Optimizing page load speed
  4. Retesting with PageSpeed Insights after improvements

### 3.7 Recommendations Section (components/recommendations-section.tsx)

- List general SEO recommendations with expandable details.
- Include information on affected pages and implementation steps.
- Use badges to indicate recommendation categories and priorities.

### 3.8 Detailed Metrics (components/detailed-metrics.tsx)

- Create tabs for different metric categories (Headers, Meta Tags, Keywords, Links).
- Display detailed information for each category using tables and appropriate visualizations.

## 4. Data Handling

- For this example, use static data within each component.
- In a real-world scenario, implement data fetching from an API or database.
- Consider using React Server Components for initial data loading and Client Components for interactivity.

## 5. Styling and Theming

- Utilize Tailwind CSS for responsive design and custom styling.
- Implement a cohesive color scheme using CSS variables for easy theme customization.
- Ensure proper contrast and readability for all text and UI elements.

## 6. Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements throughout the dashboard.
- Implement proper ARIA labels and roles for interactive elements.
- Ensure keyboard navigation works correctly for all interactive components.

## 7. Performance Optimization

- Implement code-splitting and lazy loading for larger components.
- Optimize images and use appropriate formats (WebP, SVG where possible).
- Minimize the use of client-side JavaScript where server-side rendering can be used.

## 8. Error Handling and Loading States

- Implement error boundaries to catch and display errors gracefully.
- Create loading skeletons or placeholders for components that fetch data.

## 9. Testing

- Write unit tests for individual components.
- Implement integration tests for key user flows.
- Perform cross-browser and device testing to ensure compatibility.

By following this guide, you can create a comprehensive and user-friendly SEO dashboard that provides valuable insights and recommendations for improving website SEO performance.
